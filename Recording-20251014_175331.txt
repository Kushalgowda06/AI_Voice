Knowledge AI is a module under Transition AI.
The landing page shows four panes.
The first panel shows the knowledge base overview
across various technologies curated over time,
showing the number of articles available.
The second panel shows the quality analytics
of the knowledge base that identifies articles
which are duplicate, low score in nature.
The recent SOP panel shows the articles recently created
for quick reference.
The duplicate articles block displays the articles in pairs.
The users select one of the topics
from the displayed articles
and reviews the content across both.
If the content across both is found the same,
user clicks Merge Articles.
The next page further shows the refined content
of the merged article based on various parameters
for review by the user.
Once the article is reviewed, based on the parameters,
the user then goes ahead and clicks Submit.
The low scoring articles block displays those articles
that have been rated lower than three
based on the quality index.
The user selects one of the topics
from the displayed low scored articles
and reviews the content.
The user clicks Refine for AI to enhance
and improve the content quality.
The refined content is further reviewed by the user.
As there are further changes needed,
the user clicks Edit Article and modifies the content.
The user posts editing the article
based on the changes modified,
then goes ahead and clicks Save Changes
and further submits the article.
The refined article is successfully saved and is available.
The fourth panel shows most common issues reported
where there was no knowledge article available
to resolve the incident.
The user selects an incident,
reviews the content and clicks Create Article.
The created article is reviewed,
modifications are done as required and changes are saved.
The user then reviews the updated article
and clicks Save Article.
The article with improved content is now available.
