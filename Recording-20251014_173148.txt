Problem AI is an automated problem identification and RCA-DAF creation agent under IT Ops.
The landing page shows two points where the first panel shows the problem records that have been either recommended, approved, or rejected.
The recommended records are generated via a configured scheduler function which analyzes the related incidents based on the issue and the configuration item.
For these problem records recommended by the AI to be approved or rejected, the user selects one of the recommended problem records.
The right panel shows the details of the problem records such as the shot description, description, and listed related incidents to the problem.
The user can check the box and choose the related incidents or all that may be required to generate the problem.
The problem number and the details are verified by navigating to the ITSM tool and the number is input in the search bar.
The details captured during problem creation such as problem statement are now seen on the problem ticket in the ITSM tool.
