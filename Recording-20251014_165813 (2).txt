Incident AI is a Gen AI solution automating
executional ticket updates.
Upon clicking Incident AI, on the left
is an incident view pane displaying
the category with incidents assigned to the logged in user.
The unassigned tickets category
displays the incidents that have no user or assignment
group mapped.
Under the assigned incidents, let's select an incident.
The view now shows three panes.
The first panel shows the details
of the selected incidents, such as state assigned
to assignment group, shot description, description,
comments, work notes, and resolution notes.
The analysis panel shows the related incidents
and changes to the current incident to be acted upon.
The tech assist panel shows the summary of the issue
and generates diagnostic and resolution steps
based on the knowledge articles related to the issue.
It also allows users to type in the prompt
to help act on the incident.
The user reviews the detailed steps
and executes them by entering the prompt for execution.
Tech assist generates a summary
of the resolution with stepwise analysis and execution.
In parallel, the comments, work notes on the incident
panel are updated with the resolution steps captured
in the tech assist panel.
The state of the incident is auto updated to resolved,
thereby ensuring updates to resolution notes
as well in the incident.
Upon verification, the user clicks Update Ticket
to have the updates reflected successfully.
The next incident is lined up and is displayed
on the incident panel.
The user may choose to select the incidents
from the unassigned category by mapping the assignee name
and the assigned group.
Once done, the user goes ahead and clicks Update Ticket
and ensures that the ticket is assigned
to him for further action.
